This is because Python's asyncio only added full support for passing context in version 3.11.\\nWhy‚Äã\\nLangChain and LangSmith SDK use contextvars to propagate tracing information implicitly. In Python 3.11 and above, this works seamlessly. However, in earlier versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10), asyncio tasks lack proper contextvar support, which can lead to disconnected traces.\\nTo resolve‚Äã\\n\\nContext propagation using threading‚Äã\\nIt's common to start tracing and want to apply some parallelism on child tasks all within a single trace. Python's stdlib ThreadPoolExecutor by default breaks tracing.\\nWhy‚Äã\\nPython's contextvars start empty within new threads. Here are two approaches to handle maintain trace contiguity:\\nTo resolve‚Äã\\n\\n\\nUsing LangSmith's ContextThreadPoolExecutor\\nLangSmith provides a ContextThreadPoolExecutor that automatically handles context propagation:\\nfrom langsmith.utils import ContextThreadPoolExecutorfrom langsmith import traceable@traceabledef outer_func():    with ContextThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:        inputs = [1, 2]        r = list(executor.map(inner_func, inputs))@traceabledef inner_func(x):    print(x)outer_func()\\n\\n\\nManually providing the parent run tree\\nAlternatively, you can manually pass the parent run tree to the inner function:\\nfrom langsmith import traceable, get_current_run_treefrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor@traceabledef outer_func():    rt = get_current_run_tree()    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:        r = list(            executor.map(                lambda x: inner_func(x, langsmith_extra={\\\"parent\\\": rt}), [1, 2]            )        )@traceabledef inner_func(x):    print(x)outer_func()\\nIn this approach, we use get_current_run_tree() to obtain the current run tree and pass it to the inner function using the langsmith_extra parameter. \\n\\n \"\"\",\n",

       "'To set up tracing to LangSmith using the `@traceable` decorator, you\\'ll typically need to follow a few general steps. However, keep in mind that the precise implementation might vary based on your environment or the version of the libraries being used. Below is a general guide to help you get started:\\n\\n1. **Install the LangSmith SDK**: Make sure you have the LangSmith SDK installed in your project. You can usually install it using pip:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   pip install langsmith\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Import the Required Packages**: Import the necessary modules in your Python script. You\\'ll need to import the `traceable` decorator from LangSmith.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   from langsmith import traceable\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Wrap Your Functions with the @traceable Decorator**: You can now use the `@traceable` decorator to wrap the functions you want to trace. Here‚Äôs an example:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   @traceable\\n   def my_function(param1, param2):\\n       # Your function logic here\\n       result = param1 + param2\\n       return result\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Configure the LangSmith Client**: Depending on your setup, you may need to configure the LangSmith client with your API key or project details. This could typically be done in a configuration file or directly in your code:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   from langsmith import Client\\n\\n   client = Client(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Run Your Traced Function**: When you call `my_function`, it will now automatically send trace data to LangSmith.\\n\\n6. **Check Your LangSmith Dashboard**: After running your application, you can check the LangSmith dashboard to see the traces that have been recorded.\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n\\n- Make sure to refer to the LangSmith documentation for any specific requirements or configuration settings.\\n- You might have additional options for customizing the tracing behavior, such as specifying metadata or tags for the traces.\\n- If you are working with an asynchronous application, check if there are specific guidelines or decorators for async functions.\\n\\nThis is a guide to get you started with tracing using the `@traceable` decorator. If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements, consulting the LangSmith documentation or support may provide additional details tailored to your needs.'"

       "'Tracing with a dataset typically means tracking the flow of data through a system or analyzing how data changes over time or across different operations. Here‚Äôs a general approach you can take to accomplish this:\\n\\n### 1. **Define Objective**\\n   - Identify what you want to trace: changes over time, data flow through processes, performance metrics, user interactions, etc.\\n\\n### 2. **Data Collection**\\n   - Gather the dataset you want to trace. This could be from various sources:\\n     - Databases\\n     - Logs (application, server)\\n     - User interactions (click streams)\\n     - APIs\\n\\n### 3. **Set Up Tracking Mechanisms**\\n   - If you are handling new data points or changes, ensure you have mechanisms in place to log these changes.\\n   - Use:\\n     - **Event logging** to capture significant events.\\n     - **Change data capture (CDC)** to track changes in databases.\\n\\n### 4. **Data Preparation**\\n   - Clean and preprocess the dataset:\\n     - Handle missing values\\n     - Normalize or standardize data if necessary\\n     - Convert data types as required.\\n\\n### 5. **Create Tracing Rules/Models**\\n   - Establish what aspects of the data you want to trace. This might include:\\n     - Source of data\\n     - Timestamp of changes\\n     - User interactions\\n     - Processing steps.\\n\\n### 6. **Visualization and Analysis**\\n   - Use tools and techniques to visualize the tracing:\\n     - Graphs (line graphs, bar charts) to show changes over time\\n     - Flow diagrams to illustrate data movement.\\n   - Utilize libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn (for Python), or tools like Tableau, Power BI for visualization.\\n\\n### 7. **Monitoring and Logging**\\n   - Implement a logging system to keep track of changes in real-time:\\n     - Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Grafana, or custom logging solutions can help.\\n   - Monitor performance metrics and alerts.\\n\\n### 8. **Review and Iterate**\\n   - Regularly review the tracing outputs and refine your analysis.\\n   - Address any gaps or issues that arise in the tracing process.\\n\\n### 9. **Documentation**\\n   - Keep detailed documentation on what has been traced, methodologies used, and findings to ensure reproducibility and transparency in your tracing efforts.\\n\\n### Example Use Cases\\n- **Data Quality Monitoring**: Track errors or anomalies in datasets over time.\\n- **Change Tracking in Databases**: Monitor how records are updated, inserted, or deleted.\\n- **User Behavior Tracing**: Analyze how users interact with your application and how their data evolves.\\n\\n### Tools\\n- **Python Libraries**: pandas, NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib, seaborn for visualization.\\n- **Database Tools**: SQL for querying historical data.\\n- **ETL Tools**: Apache Kafka, Talend for data integration and tracing.\\n\\nIn conclusion, tracing a dataset involves setting up a systematic approach to capturing, analyzing, and visualizing data flow and changes. Tailor these steps to fit the specific context and objectives of your dataset and use case.'"
